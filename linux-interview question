ssh

SSH (Secure Shell) is a network protocol that enables secure remote connections between two systems

ls
==

list of files/folders presnt in the current location

cd
==

cp

rsync
======

scp provides a cp like method to copy files from one machine to a remote machine over a secure SSH connection. rsync allows you to syncronise remote folders. 
They are different programs and both have their uses. scp is always secure, whereas rsync must travel over SSH to be secure.
